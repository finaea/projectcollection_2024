# Handwritten Digit Recognition with Neural Networks
This code repository is an implementation of a neural network for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. The project aims to build a model capable of accurately classifying digits from 0 to 9 based on pixel intensities.


### Prerequisites
To run the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Seaborn

You can install the required packages using the following:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Results
The trained model is evaluated on the MNIST test dataset, and the results include:

Training and validation accuracy plotted over epochs.
